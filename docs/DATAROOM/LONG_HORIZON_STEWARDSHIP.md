# Long-Horizon Stewardship Model (Internal)

Objective: define the platform’s long-term role and stewardship philosophy without optimizing for short-term valuation or chasing growth metrics.

## 1) Primary posture (chosen)

### **Cash-flow asset** (primary)

Why:
- maximizes long-run trust and durability
- prefers predictable operations over expansion complexity
- aligns with “hold strategy” and avoids valuation-driven incentives that degrade user experience

What this means:
- growth is a byproduct of compounding quality and reliability, not a target
- the platform is operated like infrastructure: stable, quiet, and boring (in the best way)

## 2) Growth constraints (explicit)

### Allowed growth

- adding partners that **improve deal quality** and maintain attribution integrity
- expanding affiliate providers **only** to reduce dependency risk and improve user outcomes
- expanding sites where operational load stays bounded and quality gates hold

### Rejected growth

- any growth that requires lowering quality thresholds (more deals, worse trust)
- any growth that increases partner leakage risk or weakens privacy posture
- any growth that depends on deceptive urgency, hidden sponsorship, or dark patterns
- any growth that requires bespoke forks or special-case governance exceptions

### When to say “no”

- when a partner demands additional scopes beyond policy (or asks for exceptions)
- when a new vendor increases lock-in or expands attack surface without a clear substitution path
- when a new site/vertical would require manual moderation or constant policing
- when monetization pressure conflicts with user trust (trust wins)

## 3) Succession scenarios (continuity)

Succession is documented separately and treated as an operational capability:
- `docs/DATAROOM/SUCCESSION.md`

Key doctrine:
- transitions must preserve governance boundaries and privacy constraints
- rotate secrets, validate kill switches, and export data room artifacts before handoff

## 4) Irreversible commitments (hard lines)

### User trust
- clear labeling (sponsored/premium) and no misleading urgency
- correctness over persuasion

### Data ethics
- raw user data stays internal; aggregates are thresholded, time-windowed, and scoped
- no cross-partner benchmarking outputs

### Platform neutrality boundaries
- monetization must not override basic quality and truthfulness
- partners do not get privileged exceptions that degrade ecosystem fairness
